# laravel-socialize

This is just a demo app that showcases some of my code base and thought patterns in laravel. This project is by no account a complete project and will be continuously worked on over time.

##Installation
1. **Clone** or **Download** project 
2. Run **composer install** to get all necessary packages 
3. **Make a copy** of the **.env.example** file to and **rename it to .env** and change the settings to **your setup requirements**. 
4. Run **php artisan migrate --seed** 

After these steps you can open the site and log in with the existing user account.
